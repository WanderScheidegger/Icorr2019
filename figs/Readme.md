This work presents a multimodal cognitive inter-action strategy aiming at walker-assisted rehabilitation thera-pies, with special focus on post-stroke patients. Such interactionstrategy is based on monitoring user’s gait and face orientationto command the displacement of the smart walker. Users areable to actively command the steering of the walker by changingtheir face orientation, while their lower limbs movement affectthe walker’s linear velocity. The proposed system is validatedusing a smart walker and the results obtained point to the fea-sibility of employing such cognitive interaction in rehabilitationtherapies.
