## A Novel Multimodal Cognitive Interaction for Walker-Assisted Rehabilitation Therapies

This  work  presents  a  multimodal  cognitive  interaction strategy  aiming  at  walker-assisted  rehabilitation  therapies,with  special  focus  on  post-stroke  patients.  Such  interactionstrategy  is  based  on  monitoring  user’s  gait  and  face  orien-tation to command the displacement of the smart walker. Insuch a follow-in-front strategy, the users are able to activelycommand the steering of the walker by changing their faceorientation,  while  their  lower  limbs  movement  affects  thewalker’s linear velocity.
