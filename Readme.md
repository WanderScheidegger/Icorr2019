## A Novel Multimodal Cognitive Interaction for Walker-Assisted Rehabilitation Therapies

This  work  presents  a  multimodal  cognitive  interaction strategy  aiming  at  walker-assisted  rehabilitation  therapies,with  special  focus  on  post-stroke  patients.  Such  interactionstrategy  is  based  on  monitoring  user’s  gait  and  face  orien-tation to command the displacement of the smart walker. Insuch a follow-in-front strategy, the users are able to activelycommand the steering of the walker by changing their faceorientation,  while  their  lower  limbs  movement  affects  thewalker’s linear velocity.

This work was presented in 16th IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR 2019), the biannual conference on theoretical and experimental issues in the fields of Rehabilitation Robotics and Neuroscience applied to Healthcare.
